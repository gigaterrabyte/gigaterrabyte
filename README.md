I am enthusiastic about furthering my knowledge within Cybersecurity field, and I would love to work with others in the field in order to accomplish my goals. I love to learn all the ins and outs of whatever projects that I am put in charge of, as well as trying to optimize them in any way that I can.  I am very passionate about protecting individuals, through guarding potentially sensitive information that I may encounter within my line of work.
